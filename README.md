# 🎧 DJS05 – Detail Page and Navigation

In this project, you’ll **level up your React skills** by building a **detailed show page** within a podcast app.  
This is where **dynamic routing**, **data fetching**, and **smooth user navigation** come together to create a rich, interactive experience.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is simple:  
When users click on a podcast, they should be taken to a **unique page** displaying all details about that show.

You’ll use **route parameters** to load the correct data dynamically and ensure each podcast has a **clean, shareable URL**.  
The project also includes building a **smart navigation system** that lets users browse through **seasons** and **episodes** easily — all while maintaining a polished, responsive interface.
